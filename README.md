Kanban is a project management methodology that allows for organizing and prioritizing projects and their tasks, using boards, lists, and cards. With the right Kanban board software, one can focus on priorities, keep the team in the loop about what’s current and what’s coming up, and control a steady flow of work, especially in output-heavy environments like production, agencies, support, and maintenance.
